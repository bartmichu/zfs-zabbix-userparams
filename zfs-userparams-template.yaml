                The virtual device has encountered a failure but is still operational.
                
                This situation is most frequently observed when a mirror or RAID-Z device has lost one or more constituent devices. The fault tolerance of the pool may be compromised, as a subsequent fault in another device could be irreparable.

                The device or virtual device is completely inaccessible.
                
                This status typically signifies a complete failure of the device, rendering it incapable of sending or receiving data to/from ZFS. If a top-level virtual device is in this state, the entire pool becomes completely inaccessible.
