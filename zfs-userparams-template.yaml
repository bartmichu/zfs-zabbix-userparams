                The virtual device has experienced a failure but can still function.
                
                This state is most common when a mirror or RAID-Z device has lost one or more constituent devices. The fault tolerance of the pool might be compromised, as a subsequent fault in another device might be unrecoverable.

                The device or virtual device is completely inaccessible.
                
                This status typically indicates total failure of the device, such that ZFS is incapable of sending data to it or receiving data from it. If a top-level virtual device is in this state, then the pool is completely inaccessible.
